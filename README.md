This is a Repo for convolutional neural network made for horses -vs - humans classification
It includes the use of Image Data generator to directly pass the data to the model .
The model is cheked with uploading images by our self .
Also there has been two files , once it has been done along with the validation . once without the validation dataset.
Using the Class Callbacks we , i have set the the traininig to stop when it reaches 75% training Accuracy.
It was interesting to note that the one without validation has 6/8 result on our test while the one with validation has 4/8 result.
It seems that the one with validatation is overfitting.
